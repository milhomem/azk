# ![azk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azukiapp/azk/master/src/pres/top-logo-wo.png)

`azk` is a tool that assists web developers in the creation, maintenance and isolation of development environments through automation. You will be able to easily and quickly create isolated environments to many projects in almost any development stack. Automation happens by the use of simple scripts and images.

## Main features

* Multiplatform: Works on Linux & Mac OS X (requires 64 bit platform in both cases)
* Images: via [Docker Registry][docker_registry]
* Built in load-balancer
* Built in file sync
* Automatic start-up (and reload) script
* Logging
* And simple and easy to use DSL to describe its architecture:

## Full Azkfile.js example

```js
// Adds the systems that shape your system
systems({
  'node-example': {
    // Dependent systems
    depends: ["db"],
    // More images:  http://registry.hub.docker.com
    image: "dockerfile/nodejs",
    // Steps to execute before running instances
    provision: [
      "npm install",
    ],
    workdir: "/azk/#{manifest.dir}",
    command: "node index.js",
    mounts: {
      // Mounts folders to assigned paths
      "/azk/#{manifest.dir}": path("."),
    },
    // Start with 2 instances
    scalable: { default: 2}
    // Set hostname to use in http balancer
    http: {
      // node-example.dev.azk.io
      domains: [ "#{system.name}.#{azk.default_domain}" ],
    },
    envs: {
      // Exports global variables
      NODE_ENV: "dev",
    },
  },

  db: {
    image: "tutum/mysql",
    mounts: {
      // Activates a persistent data folder in '/data'
      "/data": persistent("data-#{system.name}"),
    },
    ports: {
      data: "3306/tcp",
    },
    envs: {
      MYSQL_PASS: "senha",
      MYSQL_USER: "admin",
    },
    export_envs: {
      DATABASE_URL: "mysql://#{envs.MYSQL_USER}:#{envs.MYSQL_PASS}@#{net.host}:#{net.port.data}/",
    },
  },
});

// Sets a default system (to use: start, stop, status, scale)
setDefault("node-example")
```

## Quick start

### Basic Vocabulary

#### System of Systems

`azk` is based on the concept of [System of Systems][sos]. Accordingly, applications (your code), services and workers (such as databases, webservers and queue systems) are treated as systems that communicate with each other and together make the primary system. Using this paradigm, `azk` installs and manages development environments. While this may seem overkill at first, it actually makes it a lot easier to manage the development and execution environments of an application (in its parts - the "systems" - or in its entirety - the full "system of systems").

#### Images

In order to automate the provisioning of development environments, `azk` uses pre-built custom images. These images follow the [Docker][docker] standard and can be found in: [Docker Index][docker_index] or [Dockerfile][dockerfile].

#### Azkfile.js

`Azkfile.js` files are the cornerstone of how to use `azk`. These simple manifest files describe the systems that make your system of systems as well as the images used in their execution. They also describe parameters and execution options.

[Full](#full_manifest_example) Azkfile.js example

### Starting a new application project:

If you are starting a new application project, you can already use `azk` to obtain the proper runtime as well the corresponding generators for your chosen language and then generate the application's basic structure. An example in node.js would look like this:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects
$ azk shell --image dockerfile/node # obtaining the runtime
    # mkdir app-name
    # npm init                      # building the application's basic structure
    ...
    # exit
$ cd app-name
$ azk init
azk: 'Azkfile.js' generated
$ azk start
```

### Taming an existing application project's development environment with `azk`:

When you already have an application project going on and want to use `azk` to streamline its development environment, all you have to do is as follows:

```bash
$ cd [my_application_folder]
$ azk init
azk: 'Azkfile.js' generated
...
$ azk start
```

## Important steps before upgrading from azk <= 0.5.1

Until recently, version `0.6.0` was still an alpha version, but now it has reached a maturity level that makes it a beta version (now it can be installed and updated by installation packages).

For those who have tested it before (pior to this beta version), please perform the following procedures before installing the new version:

1. **Warning:** `azk 0.6.0` is NOT backward compatible with prior versions, therefore your persistent folders like dependencies or databases will be deleted. To perform a backup:

  ```bash
  $ azk agent stop
  $ cp -Rf ~/.azk/data [path_to_backup]
  ```

2. For projects in which you were already using `azk`, it is required to update azkfile.js, replacing `mounts_folders` and `persistent_folders` for mounts, according to the following example:

  Where used to be: 

    ```javascript
    systems({
      example: {
        // ...
        mounts_folders: { ".": "/azk/#{system.name}" },
        persistent_folders: [ "/data" ],
      }
    });
    ```

  It should be replaced by (note the inversion of the values of `mounts_folders`):

    ```javascript
    systems({
      example: {
        // ...
        mounts: {
          "/azk/#{system.name}": path("."),
          "/data": persistent("data"),
        },
      }
    });
    ```

3. Next time you execute the start command in one of these projects, it must be done this way:

  ```bash
  $ azk start --reprovision
  ```

4. Finally, you can remove an old `azk` installation:

  ```bash
  $ azk agent stop
  $ azk vm remove # mac only
  $ rm -Rf ~/.azk
  $ sudo rm /etc/resolver/azk.dev
  # and remove `~/.azk/bin` from your `$PATH`
  ```

5. Now you are able to install new `azk` version.

## Installation

### Requirements

* Mac OS X or Linux (requires 64 bit platform) (Windows: planned)
* bash
* Internet connection

### Installation from package (recommending)

#### Mac OS X

It is necessary to install Virtualbox and an extra tool for file synchronization:

* [VirtualBox][virtualbox_dl], version 4.3.6+ (VMware: planned)

Using [Homebrew Cask][homebrew_cask]? It makes installing VirtualBox super easy!

```sh
$ brew cask install virtualbox --appdir=/Applications
```

Now the installation of `azk`:

```sh
$ brew install azukiapp/azk/azk
```

#### Linux

* Distribution (tested): Ubuntu 12.04/14.04 and Fedora20
* [Docker][docker] 1.1.0 or greater
* Not running any service in `80` and `53` ports

If you are running a service on ports `80` or/and `53` you can customize the configuration by setting the environment variable `AZK_BALANCER_PORT` and `AZK_DNS_PORT` respectively before run `azk agent start`.

## Usage/Features

```bash
# Control azk agent
$ azk agent start                 # Starts azk agent in background
$ azk agent status                # Shows azk agent status
$ azk agent stop                  # Stops azk agent

# Create initial Azkfile.js
$ azk init [project_path]

# Run a shell in instances context
$ azk shell                       # Runs shell in default system
$ azk shell -c "ls -l /"          # Runs specific command
$ azk shell -m ~/:/azk/user       # Running with aditional mounting

# Run a shell in arbitrary image
$ azk shell -i busybox            # Runs a shell in arbitrary imagem

# Run background systems (Azkfie.js#systems)
$ azk start                       # Starts all systems
$ azk start [system_name,...]     # Starts specific systems
$ azk stop                        # Stops specific service
$ azk status                      # Displays all systems statuses
$ azk stop [system_name,...]      # Stops specific systems by names
$ azk scale [system_name,...] 5   # Starts 5 instances of specific systems

```

## Contributions and testing (for experts only)

First [install azk](#install_from_source) in from the source. Now you can run tests:

  ```bash
  $ cd ~/.azk
  $ azk nvm grunt test
  ```
Note that running these tests requires you to have `azk agent` running.
